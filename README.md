This app helps you to find movies that are shown in metropolitan area today. We choose to limit theaters and search to only in metropolitan area, because if user wants to know more it will go to Finnkino's website. The app is intended to serve as a tool if the user wants to check what movies in the metropolitan area are playing today and wants quick information about the movies currently being shown.
